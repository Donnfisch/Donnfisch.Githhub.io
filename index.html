                        <p>My name is Donald but i go by Donnie. I am semi-new to the coding world but eager to learn
                            all i can. I try to excel at anything I do and I'm always striving to be the at the top of what
                            I am doing.</p>
                        <p>I am a U.S. Navy veteran. I was an Electronics technician working on communications and RADAR gear 
                            onboard my ship. I was the leading petty officer of my division and earned three Navy and Marine Corps
                            achievement awards. I have vast experience in the hardware side of electronics and am looking forward 
                            to gaining all the available knowledge in the coding side.
